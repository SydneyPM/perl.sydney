About Us
--------

Sydney Perl Mongers is a user group for Perl developers and enthusiasts based in and around Sydney, Australia.

We have been holding social and technical meetings since the halycon dotcom days of 1998. Like many user groups, we have peaks and troughs in social activity, with out of town visitors often serving as the catalyst for a catch up.  We're part of the [Perl Mongers](http://www.pm.org) organisation which has user groups around the world.

There is no formal membership, we are simply geeks who enjoy getting together to enjoy our mutual passion.

We Meet Regularly
-----------------

Thanks to generous hosts we meet regularly to eat pizza, drink alcoholic beverages (in moderation of course) and to discuss the Perl language + technology in general. Meetings are semi-formal, mostly happening each month. Featuring a speaker or two with plenty of opportunity to ask questions, have engaging discussions and enjoy the fellowship of mutual interests.

We also meet socially for dinner, especially if someone is in town and would like some good company.  If you are visiting Sydney for work or pleasure, let us know so we have a good excuse to get together!

Meetings are announced on the [mailing list](http://mail.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/sydney-pm/) as well as on our various social media presences.

If your organisation would like to host a meeting, please contact us via the _Email Discussion List_ details that follow.

Email Discussion List
---------------------

The [mailing list](http://mail.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/sydney-pm) is our main point of contact for discussing upcoming meetings and sharing Perl-related news or topics of interest.

Discussion is generally low volume but high in fibre.  Some posts may contain nuts.
