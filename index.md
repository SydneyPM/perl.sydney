About Us
--------

Sydney Perl Mongers is a user group for Perl developers and enthusiasts based in and around Sydney, Australia.

Sydney.pm has been holding social and technical meetings since the halycon dotcom days of 1998.  Like many user groups, we have peaks and troughs in social activity, with out of town visitors often serving as the catalyst for a catch up.  We're part of the <a href="http://www.pm.org/">Perl Mongers</a> organisation which has user groups around the world.

Email Discussion List
---------------------

The <a href="http://mail.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/sydney-pm/">mailing list</a> is our main point of contact for discussing upcoming meetings and sharing Perl-related news or topics of interest.

Discussion is generally low volume but high in fibre.  Some posts may contain nuts.

For job postings, we politely suggest recruiters use <a href="http://jobs.perl.org">jobs.perl.org</a>.

Regular Meetings
----------------

Our meeting agendas vary from presentations and quizzes through to purely social catchups.  Anyone is welcome to join us, regardless of your level of experience in Perl.

Meetings are announced on the <a href="http://mail.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/sydney-pm/">mailing list</a>.  Sydney.pm is currently in a quiescent period, with occasional meetups for visiting Perl dignitaries but no regular meetups.
